                    <span class="step-title">Campaign budget.</span> The marketing plan should be flexible and have a lot of sub plans. We always try to perform the first iteration of the plan with fewer resources and boost budget only if we see first signs of stable cash flow. It is very important to have the budget for the whole campaign before the start because sometimes solid results come only in few months. Agree, it wouldn't be wise to end the journey just before the success corner.

We always create different landing pages, we play with the designs and the messages. Our goal is to study the user experience and improve it. So-called "warm maps" help us see where people click and how they scroll. This approach ensures excellent results, and we always have to succeed together with our clients.
