                Mobile marketing can not only sell and engage users. It collects data. With good data, you can reach clients better and just earn more.

                <span class="marked">Applications.</span> Apps are earning more and more money, while even «free to play» of them generate millions of revenues. Any business can have an app: is it fitness trainer, or bank; legal advisor or car store. Applications open the new way of entertaining the audience with new edge experience. Mobile phones can become your agent in the hands of your client now.

                <span class="marked">Video advertising.</span> Money is flowing away from TV and offline ads - into the digital sphere. Mobile video advertising was huge in 2016: 75% of video watched via Facebook were watched through mobile devices. Note: it's better to have short 1-3 minutes video than 16-30 minutes movies.
